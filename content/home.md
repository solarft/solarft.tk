## ï‰– Hello, I'm Solarft  

I am Ahmad **Ibrahim** Shahmi, aliased with the name of 'Solarft' (pronounced solar-eff-tee). I prefer being called Solarft when I am on the Internet. I like to do coding, although im quite at the beginner stage, but I'm quite familiar with basic syntax-ish stuff like YAML or TOML. I also like to selfhost my own services such as [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) and [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden). Anyways I don't know what I'm doing now I'm learning embedded programming with C for NXP's Freedom Board(FRDM-KL26Z) based off of the ARM archtecture because my grandfather just got myself that board.

I am a professional dum-dum from **Malaysia**.
