# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Solarft

I am Ahmad **Ibrahim** Shahmi, aliased with the name of 'Solarft' (pronounced solar-eff-tee). I prefer being called Solarft when I am on the Internet. I like to do coding, although im quite at the beginner stage, but I'm quite familiar with basic syntax-ish stuff like YAML or TOML. I also like to selfhost my own services such as Navidrome and Vaultwarden. I'm quite a big fan of the [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)(mocha specifically).

I am a professional dum-dum from **Malaysia** ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾.
